/*

In _mixins.scss, create some mixin functionsâ€¦

@mixin borderRadius($radius) - create border radius rules based on $radius

@mixin flex() - take in params that would output a proper set of flex rules (row/column, spacing, etc)

@mixin center() - make it easy on yourself to center things vertically and/or horizontally.

Make some border mixins (with good names) that you can call to apply various box shadow effects

This file will (and should) grow with you over time as you find opportunities to create re-usable functionality.

Generally, a proper use of mixins in sass is to provide a full set of css rules, including browser prefixes.
